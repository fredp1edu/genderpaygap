#GenderPayGap
============

## This web application will be used to compare salaries of different genders with the same level of expertise and experience.
## We were able to obtain our data, based on these charts http://developer.dol.gov/expanding-growth/bls-occupational-employment-statistics-survey-oes#OE_FOOTNOTE

This is a collaboratively developed web application created during the CUNYCodes sessions in Spring 2017 using Node, Express, Handlebars and MongoDB.  

Users are prompted to submit their email addresses, checked against existing emails in Mongo, then asked a series of questions about job experiences, which are all recorded to Mongo. Further corrections and implementations are necessary. 


After, you should do `node gpgmain.js` to have Node execute our JS file. Then you
should open up your preferential web browser and type in: `localhost:3000` to run
the web app locally.
